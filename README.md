Here we are creating a memory game using the simple concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can check the demo of the game here.

Here is a general outline of the steps you can follow to develop the logic for a memory game:

* Create a game board by arranging 12 cards in a grid. Remember to have a duplicate of each card. So in total, you will have 24 cards.

* Shuffle the cards and place them face down on the game board.

* Allow the player to select two cards by clicking on them.

* Flip the selected cards over to reveal their images.

* If the selected cards match, remove them from the game board. If they do not match, flip them back over and allow the player to select two more cards.

* Repeat this process until all the cards have been matched and removed from the game board. The player wins the game when all the cards have been matched.
